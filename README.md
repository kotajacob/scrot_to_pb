# scrot_to_pb
Fair warning this is sorta shit since I hacked it together at 4:30am woo!

You'll need these packages to use it.
If you don't use firefox or don't want it to open firefox edit the code and recompile with g++

sudo pacman -S xclip firefox scrot curl

I put a link to the binary in ~/bin/ then in my i3 config I set mod+s exec ~/bin/stpb
